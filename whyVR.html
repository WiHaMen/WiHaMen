								<h3>Why is VR interesting?</h3>
								<p>What was your first impression when you first heard about virtual reality (VR)?
									If you wear a VR headset, you can experience a virtual world and you can interact in this world.
									Since this is a fake world, you can do whatever you want! You can fly do some magics and see dragons.
									Although the first impression is very powerful, people won't use it in a long term because this is pretty exhuasting to play long.
									Some people believe that if the equality of VR improves, people would keep playing it.
									Right in some parts, wrong in others.
									The main problem is that virtual world is virtual world. It can never beat the real world.
									If you are developing VR related stuff, you would know how amazingly the nature works.
									People can't leave this world and they shoudn't. Of course, there are also many othe reasons.
									For example, VR headsets are expensive, and there are not many contents to enjoy.
									So far most of the VR users are using it to play video games. 
									However, video games are comsumable and making video games for VR needs a lot more resources than computer games.
									Moreover, to play a good game, you also need a good computer, then to play a good VR game, you have to spend a lot of money.
									Due to these reasons, people are mostly developing this area for industry use.
									But, of course there are companies dreaming VR headsets to be the next smartphone.

								<h4>VR headsets shouldn't be the next smartphone</h4>
								<p>Why? Because it won't make people happy at the end.
									Smartphones are very useful tool. 
									There are a lot of useful applications to learn new things and they support our daily lifes (ex. google map).
									We don't have to go shopping and groceries. Everying is possible at home.
									There are even friends in the screen. We chat with them. We even don't have to meet real persons.
									Recentlly, ChatGPT is listening our words very well.
									However, we know very well that we would be unhappy if we stick to only the screen.
									At the send, what we are seeing through the screen are fake. Not very different from the virtual world.
									We are from the nature and are social animals. 
									Many researches show that people are happier when they are close to the nature and have good relationshipes with real people.
									Now you can easily imagine the world where all of the people are wearing VR headsets.
									We would stick the screen after eyes and the connections with the nature would get weaker. 
									This is the reason why VR headsets shouldn't be the next smartphone.

								<h4>Technologies are there</h4>
								<p>Can we stop developing technologies? The answer is NO. 
									although there are many people who are afraid of AI, we invest even more in this field.
									Because, despite its drawbacks, they remain extremely useful tools.
									<strong>Here is the point why I came up with this WiHaMen project.</strong>
									If we can't stop technologies, we can use them to put ourselves under the environment where we can use it in a wise way.
									The number of remote workers have been increased due to its convenience.
									This means that unless they are active enouth to meet people, it wouldn't be easy to feel social connections.
									Maybe even some people won't go out at all so have almost no step in a day.
									So, I want to make a community centered to people living close to each other.
									If you can work here in a good condition, people would come. 
									And they would have chances to meet people and they will find people who share the same hobbies, ideally sports.
									These all approaches are not only for employees but also employers.
									If their employees can feel better sense of belonging through VR meetings and they can go sports with their neighbors after work,
									I'm pretty sure that their work efficiency would increase with their physical and metal well-being.
									The company also shouldn't be big enough to run all the offices but just can be one of the members of WiHaMen.
									WiHaMenVR will help people to talk to their team mates while having eye-contact.
									WiHaMenStory will help people to find people who can enjoy their hobbies together.
									People will keep using smartphone and VR headsets, but not too much.
									Because I believe that people know that it is more fun to have fun with real people in the nature.
									We are from the nature and social animals.
									If the environment is right enough, people would find the best way to live with happiness.
									I hope that this WiHamen project will be the first step in this direction.
