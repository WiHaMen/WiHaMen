								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/VRmeeting1.png" alt="" /></span>WiHaMen offers rooms with all the equipment for our VR meeting software. 
								WiHaMenVR is very easy to use because of its simplicity. VR controllers are not needed. You use only your hands and a keyboard that you are already familier with.
								WiHaMenVR is designed for small team meetings (up to 8 people). The meetings take place in a cabin with beautiful mountain views.
								If some members want to have a more private discussion afterward, they can go downstairs to a cozy, comfortable space.</p>
								<p>You can feel their presence around you and communicate with them through eye contact.</p>

								<h3>Video Meeting</h3>
								<p>If you attend a big conference, so you don't need a close conntact with people, you can use the quiet and uninterrupted rooms for your meeting.
									There is a webcam if you don't have a proper one. There won't be anyone who interrupt you while your meeting and you also won't bother your family or roomates.

								<h4>Clubs</h4>

								The daily grind would be slowly wearing you down if you don't have any other activities except from your work. 
								To find small everyday accomplishments, you can connect with people who don’t necessarily work with you but share the same interests.
								If you already have a hobby, it feels great to help others learn about it.
								If you don’t have one yet, you can discover a new hobby here with your neighbors. 
								WiHaMenStory offers a funtion that allows people to upload temporary posts to find neighbors for their clubs.
								You can either upload a post or send an email to find others who enjoy the same hobbies!

									However, living in the center of a big city is expensive, and the dense population can be stressful.
									WiHaMen branches are located in the place where you can save on rent, stay connected to the city, and enjoy a natural environment.
									Let’s commute to work by bike!
